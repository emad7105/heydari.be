title: About me
---

I am a PostDoc researcher at the [COSIC][cosic] research group and at [LANTAM][lantam] taskforce of the [imec-DistriNet][distrinet] research group at [KU Leuven][kul] in Belgium. 


My research activities are supervised by 
- [Prof. Nigel Smart][ns]
- [Prof. Wouter Joosen][wj]
- [Dr. Bert Lagaisse][bl] (senior IOF)


Research interests ([more here][research]):
- Secure multiparty computation ([MPC][mpc]) and homomorphic encryption ([HE][he])
- Storage security using applied cryptography 
- Middleware and software architecture: adaptation, reflection and data security
- Cloud computing infrastructure: capacity planning, container orchestration frameworks


I received a PhD degree from KU Leuven (Belgium, 2021), a Master's degree in _distributed systems and computer networks_ from the [University of Antwerp][ua] (Belgium, 2014), and a Bachelor's degrees in _computer hardware engineering_ from the [University of Isfahan][ui] (Iran, 2010). 

Previously, I was a research associate at the imec-DistriNet research group, KU Leuven. Before joining imec-DistriNet, I worked on cloud computing subjects in [Alcatel-Lucent][alcatel] (now [Nokia][nokia]) as part of my Master's thesis research. Furthermore, I worked for a number of years in the software industry as a software engineer in the Brussels region.

__The latest news and what am I doing now?__
- Ourt [paper][defired] has been accepted and presented at the [EuroSec '22][eurosec22] of [EuroSys '22][eurosys22] in Rennes, France.
- I will be attending: [EuroSys '22][eurosys22] and [Real-World Crypto (RWC '22)][rwc22].
- Our [paper][icsocpaper] has been accepted at [ICSOC '21][icsoc] (15% acceptance rate); the paper was based on a collaboration with several colleagues at [distrinet][distrinet] and a Flemish industry partner.
- I successfully defended my PhD on November 18, 2021.
- At [COSIC][cosic], my current goal is to understand and explore the applications of secure multiparty computation ([MPC][mpc]) and homomorphic encryption ([HE][he]).

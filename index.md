title: About me
---

I am a researcher at [Bell Labs][bell] and a Postdoc at [COSIC][cosic] ([KU Leuven][kul]) (supervised by [Prof. Nigel Smart][ns]). Previously, I worked as a PostDoc at [imec-DistriNet][distrinet] (supervised by [Prof. Wouter Joosen][wj]) where I also completed my [PhD][phd] in 2021.

Research interests ([more here][research]):
- Computing on encrypted data: Secure multiparty computation ([MPC][mpc]) & Homomorphic encryption ([HE][he])
- Security and privacy for streaming, storages and data sharing systems: Zero-knowledge proofs ([ZKP][zkp]) & Encrypted search
- Middleware and software architecture: adaptation, reflection and data security
- [previously] Cloud computing infrastructure: capacity planning, container orchestration frameworks

__COED Industry Days:__ I am a co-organizer of computing-on-encrypted-data industry days. Other co-organizers are [Prof. Nigel Smart][ns], [Svetla Nikova][svetla], [Emmanuela Orsini][emma]. Previous editions: 
- 2021 - [Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)][coed21] (code: COED4321)
- 2022 - [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)][coed22]


I received a PhD degree from KU Leuven (Belgium, 2021), a Master's degree in _distributed systems and computer networks_ from the [University of Antwerp][ua] (Belgium, 2014), and a Bachelor's degrees in _computer hardware engineering_ from the [University of Isfahan][ui] (Iran, 2010). 

Previously, I was a research associate at the imec-DistriNet research group, KU Leuven. Before joining imec-DistriNet, I worked on cloud computing subjects in [Alcatel-Lucent][alcatel] (now [Nokia][nokia]) as part of my Master's thesis research. Furthermore, I worked for a number of years in the software industry as a software engineer in the Brussels region.

__The latest news and what am I doing now?__
- Our recent work is out on [eprint][bbmpc] (2023); we present and thoroughly evaluate a star-like networking model for MPC protocols with stragglers.
- Our recent [paper][BeauForT] on "Robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance for
Client-centric Mobile Web Applications" has been published in ([IEEE TPDS][BeauForTdoi] 2023)
- Joined [Bell Labs][bell] in 2022.
- Our [paper][defired] has been accepted and presented at the [EuroSec '22][eurosec22] of [EuroSys '22][eurosys22] in Rennes, France.
- I will be attending: [EuroSys '22][eurosys22] and [Real-World Crypto (RWC '22)][rwc22].
- Our [paper][icsocpaper] has been accepted at [ICSOC '21][icsoc] (15% acceptance rate); the paper was based on a collaboration with several colleagues at [distrinet][distrinet] and a Flemish industry partner.

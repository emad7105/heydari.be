title: About me
---

I am a cryptography research scientist at [Bell Labs][bell] and a Postdoc at [COSIC][cosic] ([KU Leuven][kul]) (advised by [Prof. Nigel Smart][ns]). Previously, I worked as a PostDoc at [imec-DistriNet][distrinet] (advised by [Prof. Wouter Joosen][wj]) where I also completed my [PhD][phd] in 2021.

Research interests ([more here][research]):
- Computing on encrypted data: Secure multiparty computation ([MPC][mpc]) & Homomorphic encryption ([HE][he])
- Security and privacy for streaming, storages and data sharing systems: Zero-knowledge proofs ([ZKP][zkp]) & Encrypted search
- Middleware and software architecture: adaptation, reflection and data security
- [previously] Cloud computing infrastructure: capacity planning, container orchestration frameworks

__COED Industry Days:__ I am a co-organizer of computing-on-encrypted-data industry days. Other co-organizers are [Prof. Nigel Smart][ns], [Prof. Ingrid Verbauwhede][iv], [Svetla Nikova][svetla], and [Emmanuela Orsini][emma]. Previous editions: 
- 2024 - [Leuven Hardware Acceleration Summit for FHE+ZKP][coed24]
- 2023 - [Legal, policy and government applications][coed23]
- 2022 - [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)][coed22]
- 2021 - [Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC)][coed21] (code: COED4321)


I received a Ph.D. from KU Leuven (Belgium, 2021), a Master's degree in distributed systems and computer networks from the [University of Antwerp][ua] (Belgium, 2014), and a Bachelor's degree in computer hardware engineering from the [University of Isfahan][ui] (Iran, 2010). 

Previously, I was a research associate at the imec-DistriNet research group, KU Leuven. Before joining imec-DistriNet, I worked on cloud computing subjects in [Alcatel-Lucent][alcatel] (now [Nokia][nokia]) as part of my Master's thesis research. Furthermore, I worked for a number of years in the software industry as a software engineer in the Brussels region.

__The latest news and what am I doing now?__
- Currently, our Leuven COED Summit speaker line-up includes Intel, Google, Niobium Microsystems, COSIC, Ingonyama, Optalysys and Fabric Cryptography.
- I will be attending [Real-World Crypto (RWC '24)][rwc24].
- Our recent [paper][relay] on "MPC With Delayed Parties Over Star-Like Networks" has been accepted at [Asiacrypt][asiacrypt23], one of the IACR flagship conferences.
- I hosted [Sylvain Chatel][sylvain] from [EPFL][epflspring] at Bell Labs in 2023, and together, we initiated the applied FHE research in the lab.
- I hosted two PhD interns at Bell Labs in 2023: (1) [Mariana Gama][mariana], and (2) [Erik Pohle][erik], and together we advanced the MPC research in the lab.
- Our recent [paper][BeauForT] on "Robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance for
Client-centric Mobile Web Applications" has been published in ([IEEE TPDS][BeauForTdoi] 2023)

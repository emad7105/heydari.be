title: About me
---

I am a computer science Ph.D. candidate at the [LANTAM][lantam] taskforce of the [imec-DistriNet][distrinet] research group at [KU Leuven][kul] in Belgium. 


My research activities are supervised by 
- [Prof. dr. ir. Wouter Joosen][wj] and 
- [Dr. Bert Lagaisse][bl] (senior IOF). 


Research interests ([more here][research]):
- Storage security with applied cryptography 
- Middleware and software architecture: adaptation, reflection and data security
- Cloud computing infrastructure: capacity planning, container orchestration frameworks


I received a Master's degree in _distributed systems and computer networks_ from the [University of Antwerp][ua] (Belgium, 2014), and a Bachelor's degrees in _computer hardware engineering_ from the [University of Isfahan][ui] (Iran, 2010). 

Previously, I was a research associate at the imec-DistriNet research group, KU Leuven. Before joining imec-DistriNet, I worked on cloud computing subjects in [Alcatel-Lucent][alcatel] (now [Nokia][nokia]) as part of my Master's thesis research. Furthermore, I worked for a number of years in the software industry as a software engineer in the Brussels region.

__What am I doing now?__
- Writing my PhD thesis
- Writing a paper in the scope of security of microservices in collaboration with some colleagues in our [lab][distrinet]
- Supervising 3 smart master's thesis students
- (on hold atm due to my heavy workload) Working on an extension to [ScrambleDB][scrambledb] to support more functionalities without extra leakage
- 100 other things
